# Directed_Graph

This is a directed weighted graph. It has basic functions like add vertexes and weighted edges, traverse all vertexes and edges, and record and print statictical information like number of vertexes / edges. Besides that, algorithms like Dijakstar's algorithm, Floyd - Warshall algorithm and topological sorting algorithms are also implementede in this graph. All functions and it's instructions are listed below:
